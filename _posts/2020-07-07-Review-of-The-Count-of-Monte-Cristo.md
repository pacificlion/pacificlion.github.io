He finds himself hope to escape the prison and exact revenge on people who have caused him this ordeal. In the prison, he encounters an old priest Abbe Faria whom he learns of a treasure. He persists and one day after fourteen years is able to escape the prison and finds the treasure.

Years after finding treasure, he returns to Paris, France to exact revenge on his adversaries.

The character development is excellent in Dumas with great drama. He disguises himself as a rich count from orientals and comes close to his adversaries.

The society of Paris is shown to be welcoming of strangers and is like our present society, who seeks gossip and forgets easily. The count takes necessary steps to reveal past misdeeds of his adversaries. Fernard a retired general, made fortune by betraying prince Ali Pasha with Sultan and returns to France. When his misdeed is revealed to society, he commits suicide. As for Villefort, A series of murders in his family by his second wife to secure the future of her eleven-year-old son. 

Villefort confronts her and asks her to either take her life or be tried by law. Meanwhile, Villefort prosecuted his own illegitimate son whom he was not aware was alive until later, a karmic justice as he tried to bend rules to save his father. Realizing this that he himself is not an upright person, he tries to save his wife whom he thought he has condemned to death. But, she suicides along with her son. Villefort turns mad as he has no child left.

Danglars captured by Bandits deprived of his wealth learns the true nature of starvation and is pardoned later by Edmond with some money to live.

In the end, he does have his revenge but has realized the revenge he had sought has also taken blood of innocent people related to his adversaries like Villefort’s son.

My rating: 5/5
