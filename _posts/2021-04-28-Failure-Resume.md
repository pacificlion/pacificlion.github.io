title: Failure Resume
---

A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.

This concept originated in [academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2017), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement.


## 2020

- Got reject from Georgia Tech, UCSD, UMass for MS in CS program.
- Provisonal patent was approved in 2019 by SAP, but did not materialise as patent in 2020.

## 2019
- Failed SAP Academy of Engineering exam twice. 
  - Lacked essential coding skills 
## 2017
- Failed Juspay coding round
