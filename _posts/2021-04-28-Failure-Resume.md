title: Failure Resume
---

A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.

This concept originated in [academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2017), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement.
