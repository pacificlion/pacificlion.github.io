## Review of The Science of Interstellar

![interstellar.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/interstellar.jpg)

I highly recommend reading this book shortly after watching the interstellar movie.

The author ensures explaining the topic keeping both technical and non-technical audiences in mind. This book makes you pause in between and wonder with awe how great laws of nature are and we as readers are on a journey in this book to understand how Cooper (the movie protagonist) must have acted upon these laws while maneuvering Endurance (space ship) through the black hole, Gargantua.

The book starts with a chapter detailing how the idea of the movie came into fruition and roadblocks the movie faced before getting directed by Christopher Nolan. A science-fiction movie adhering to principles of scientific laws and whenever there has to be a speculation, it should be based on the expertise of current scientists in that area.

This book has certainly helped me answer some of the questions I had after watching the movie like why they are not trying to save the earth in the first place or is the maneuvering shown of Endurance accurate representation of how real interstellar travel if possible should look like.

I am also left with more questions than what I had before reading the book, the author does provide related books at end for each chapter you liked.

I hope you guys also enjoy reading this book like I did and become curious to look for more answers in this universe as I am optimistic that just like in the movie, we as humans should be able to solve even more challenges.

My rating: 4/5
