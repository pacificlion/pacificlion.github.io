Is being mad and following an interesting path better than living in a boring reality?

Don Quixote seems at first glance only a parody of adventure books. But it is full of great satire, comedy, and wisdom. Don Quixote a person who has turned mad after reading many fictional books on knight-errantry assumes that knight-errantry is real. He convinces his neighbor Sancho Panza, a simple farmer to be a squire and go to adventures like a knight which will help Sancho become a governer one day as a reward of their adventures.

One scene, in particular, is very hilarious where don Quixote charges towards windmill claiming them to be giants. Sancho tells him otherwise. But he continues to do so and falls on his back.

In the adventure, they encounter many people who are impressed by the enormous knowledge possessed and surprised by his madness concerning the topic of knight chivalry.

He continues to exude arrogance and confidence of invincibility in spite of evidence suggesting otherwise. Sancho on other is complete opposite being a realist and coward.

The book is split into two parts as they were published some years in the gap.
At the end of part 1, Don Quixote returns to his village fooled by his neighbors in the guise of defeating giants, is instead brought to his village.

In part 2 he leaves the village and continues the journey with his squire. But this time in don Quixote universe part 1 is already published and is very popular.

This time people try to have fun at the duos expense by pretending that knight-errantry is real and play different pranks on him and his squire. Sancho does provide great comedy to the place. One such instance is Duke and Duchess who already read part 1 wants to have fun with Don Quixote and his squire.

Sancho against all odds becomes a governer albeit only for 10 days after he himself resigns after suffering many hoaxes planned by Duke who has made him the governor for his own amusement.

In one of the pranks, he is made to lash himself 3000 times or prick himself to bring the dead back to life. He also comes to know about his master's madness and takes advantage of it by fooling him by not taking lashes but giving it to nearby trees instead.

Quixote is defeated by one of the neighbours who disguises himself as a knight. In exchange for the defeat, Quixote promises to stay in his village for one year. He plans to become a shepherd. After returning to the village, he fell ill and could not continue with his plan to become shepherd but regains his sanity. He understands his foolish behavior over knight-errantry.

The ending may seem dull. But it is true to how a parody of adventures should end. Don Quixote dies peacefully unlike the books he has read on knight-errantry where knights die in combat.

I as a reader am left with numerous questions.
Would it have been better if he would have continued in his path to be the knight errant happy rather than die as a sane old man? Is society wise in making fun of a person who is mad?

My rating: 4/5
