Brian Tracy delivers what he says in the title - 21 ways to stop procrastinating. I read it after one of our company executives praised it for its impact on his work. I am a software developer and I found it very useful to gain awareness of how to increase productivity. It will certainly be useful for working professional who has a lot of distractions like impending deadlines for low-value tasks and constant work messages and emails.

In a nutshell - Do the most important task (Frog) first thing and do not see other tasks(tadpoles)

The book follows up with 2-3 exercises after each technique to implement in your life. I would recommend to analyze your current work and try to follow up after each exercise, it will be a better read instead of just skimming through the book, which I have found many readers including myself do in case of self-help books like this.

The summary of the 21 ways to Eat That Frog! is as follows:
1. Always have clarity of end goal and objectives - write on paper
2. Plan every day in advance
3. Apply the 80/20 principle (look up on google) to all activities /Impact
4. Consider the positive/negative consequences of tasks before prioritizing and working
5. Follow creative procrastination on low-value tasks
6. Follow the ABCDE method (A->Highest, E->can be dropped) to prioritize
7. Focus on key results of each task - so that job can be considered well done
8. Have top three points for - family, work, financial, health, problems in life.
9. Prepare thoroughly for pre-requisite tools, information, etc before starting a task.
10. Take one step at a time for a complex topic
11. Upgrade your key skills - read your most valued skills
12. Identify your key constraints/ bottlenecks
13. Put pressure on yourself: Imagine leaving town for a month tomorrow, which tasks will you complete today
14. Motivate yourself into action - look for good
15. Technology is a terrible master - if you are just reacting to instant messages and all emails, you can not work on an important topic as you become distracted.
16. Technology is a wonderful servant - use technology on the most important tasks and block out distracting emails and apps
17 . Focus your attention
18. Slice and dice task - break down large complex tasks into bite-sized piece
19. Create large chunks of time - extended periods of time to important tasks
20. Develop a sense of urgency - move fast on key tasks
21. Single handle every task - work without stopping until the job is 100 % complete

I would like to reiterate that though the book is short (less than 150 pages) and up to the point. It will only be useful if you follow up on each exercise and do step 1 every 6 months to see if you still have the same goal in sights.
