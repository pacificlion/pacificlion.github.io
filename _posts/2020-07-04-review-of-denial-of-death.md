Becker is good at explaining evolution of psychoanalysis and keep his point of view. The book touches upon dualism of humanity: physical and spiritual. 

Author focuses on topics like human regression of things like terror of death and great potential of life. The author also discusses works of Freud, Rank and Kierkegaard.

I personally felt he was a fan of Rank's work as he always quoted his work with great admiration. This book will make you question you about your actions and what motivates you. Are you just trying to fool yourself by doing actions to repress reality of imminent death or trying to make yourself immortal by building immortality projects. 

The conclusion chapter was really exceptional at tying all the things discussed. The book also criticises the philosophy gurus who are trying to make a religion of their own.

Author quotes Rank at end that Rank saw that 
> the orientation of men has to be always beyond their bodies , has to be grounded in healthy repressions and towards explicit immortality -- ideologies, myths of heroic transcendence.
